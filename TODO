All todos which have to be done should be here. They should be added whenever possible.


Data Fusion - Fuse the data from the different sensors.
    Test different fusion schemes - Using LRF for some parameters and ToF for others
    Projecting into different domains - Project the 3D sensors into the 2D domain and
                            other way around.
    Interpolation         - Using interpolation between the 3D and 2D sensors.
