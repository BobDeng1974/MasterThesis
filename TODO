All todos which have to be done should be here. They should be added whenever possible.


Data Fusion - Fuse the data from the different sensors.
    Test different fusion schemes - Using LRF for some parameters and ToF for others


Node Detection/Recognition - Be able to detect what kind pipe junction one is at.
    Surface Fit -           Be able to match the data with the nodes
    Curve Fit algorithms -  Find different algorithms, or find one and implement. 
    Data Filtering -        Run some kind of low-pass filter on the ToF-data.
    

Stereo Camera - Be able to give out distances from the stereo camera.
    Calibrate the camera -  Using the camera calibration toolbox in matlab to get the
                            intrisic parameters and rectification parameters
    Dense Stereo Matching - Write the program which dumps the disparity maps to disk
    Disparity Calculations- Write a matlab script which calculates the depth maps from the
                            given disparity maps.


Report -    Finish writing the report
    Stereo cam background - Need more background on the steroe camera. Matching,
                            calibration, and rectification.
    LRF background        - Background and error sources of the LRF.
    Ranging measurements  - More detailed background on how to measure ranges.
    Sensor Fusion         - How to fuse sensor measurements. 
    Topological maps      - Describe how this works

    Algorithms            - Descirbe the algorithms implemented. 
    Implementation issues - How the project was implemented. Descibre Open CV library,
                            drivers etc.
