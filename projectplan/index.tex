\section{Introduction}
The \emph{Master Thesis} at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology are the
last work on the masters degree in Engineering Cybernetics. This document will try to
predict the work flow of the project. 

\section{Product}
The product of this work will be a master thesis report. Test results from the fusion of
the sensor data will also be among the results. The project will also generate usable code
for the testing of the sensors. 

\section{Milestones and Goals}
Proper milestones and goals for the project is important to ensure a good work flow throughout the
project work. This should reflect the work progress, and maybe include some lesser
milestones when the planning of the project is more complete.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature study
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sensor study
            \item 3D/2D sensor fusion
            \item Representation of the sensor data
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Find possible solutions
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sketch integration of the sensors
            \item Find a sensor fusion approach
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Implementing the solutions and testing
    \item Discussion of the test results
    \item Final conclusions
\end{enumerate}


\section{Timeline}
Basically the master thesis work will be performed during 21 weeks of work in the spring
semester. The project start will be January 17th and the submit date is June 13th as stated in the
Master contract. 


\section{Meetings}
There will be meetings with the supervisors once a week. In this meetings the work done in
the previous week will be talked about and the next weeks work will be discussed.  


\subsection{Testing}
During the implementation phase, tests need to be performed to see how the proposed
solution performs. This tests will likely be scheduled in late April. There will be a number of
tests, which will be engineered to sort out the pro's and con's of the sensors.

        \textbf{1}  &   \paragraph{Literature Study} This should map out what is
                        stat-of-the-art now and what are the major research topics.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Study of 2D sensors 
                            \item Study of 3D sensors
                            \item Study of Sensor Fusion techniques.
                            \item Application of the above in real applications
                        \end{itemize}

        \textbf{2}  &   \paragraph{Solution Modelling} Find a solution for the problem
                        at hand. This is the natural extension to the literature study,
                        and the two milestones will possibly fuse together. 
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Define the working space of the robot and sensors. 
                            \item Find possible solutions to the problem. 
                            \item Representation of the sensor data

        \textbf{3}  &   \paragraph{Implementation and Testing} This is probably the most
                        time consuming period.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item Implement the sensor fusion strategy.
                            \item Test the possible performance gain
                            \item Test the proposed sensor data representation
                        \end{itemize}
