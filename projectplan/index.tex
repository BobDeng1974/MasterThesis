\maketitle


\section{Introduction}
The \emph{Master Thesis} at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology are the
last work on the masters degree in Engineering Cybernetics. This is the project plan for
the work which I'm going to do the spring semester at NUST. 

\section{Product}
The product of my work this semester is a report, and possibly a working program which
will help for further development of the snake robot. 


\section{Milestones and Goals}
Proper milestones for the project is important to ensure a good work flow throughout the
project work. This should reflect the work progress, and maybe include some lesser
milestones when the planning of the project is more complete.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature study
    \item Modelling and solution plotting
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find solution
            \item Model solution
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Implementation of the solution
    \item Testing of the solution
    \item Finalize the solution
\end{enumerate}



\section{Timeline}
Basically the master thesis work will be performed during 21 weeks of work in the spring
semester.
