\section{Introduction}
The \emph{Master Thesis} at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology are the
last work on the masters degree in Engineering Cybernetics. This document will try to
predict the work flow of the project. 

\section{Product}
The product of this work will be a master thesis report. There will be some test results
and possibly some usable code to be implemented on the robot.

\section{Milestones and Goals}
Proper milestones for the project is important to ensure a good work flow throughout the
project work. This should reflect the work progress, and maybe include some lesser
milestones when the planning of the project is more complete.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Literature study
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sensor study
            \item 3D/2D sensor fusion
            \item Representation of the sensor data
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Find possible solutions
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sketch integration of the sensors
            \item Find a sensor fusion approach
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Implementing the solutions and testing
    \item Discussion of the test results
    \item Final conclusions
\end{enumerate}


\section{Timeline}
Basically the master thesis work will be performed during 21 weeks of work in the spring
semester. 

Project start will be January 17th and the submit date is June 13th as stated in the
Master contract.
