Master Thesis at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

This is the final work at the masters degree in engineering cybernetics at NUST. The work
is performed at the spring of 2010. 

The work done in this master thesis is mainly focused on the PiKo snake robot developed by
SINTEF. The robot is equipped with active wheels which can be used when the robot is
traveling in confined spaces, such as pipes, vents and so forth. The idea of the robot is
to use it to inspect those places. This wheels also makes it possible for the robot to
move vertical in shafts given that the shaft is not to wide. 

The work performed in this thesis to survey the use of 2D and 3D sensors and fuse these
sensor measurements to make a good and reliable map of the environments. Secondly this
data should be represented in a good way. This thesis will also survey the different 
opportunities and possibilities that are available.
