Master Thesis at Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

This is the final work at the masters degree in engineering cybernetics at NUST. The work
is performed at the spring of 2010. 

The thesis is about Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM). The task is to design and
implement a SLAM functionality into the snake robot designed by SINTEF. The robot has
active wheels. The robot has elements which has two degrees of freedom each, meaning that
they can bend both sideways and up/downwards. This can be used when the robot are
operating in confined spaces less than some threshold, dependant on the number of elements
that the robot has, to climb vertical in the confined space, preferably a pipe, tube or
other ducts. 

The snake robot that this master thesis will concern are equipped with a time-of-flight
camera, and a laser scanner. The goal of the thesis is to make an working implementation
that solves the SLAM problem. 

That is what I think, anyway.
