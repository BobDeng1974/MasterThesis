Study plan

Temporary problem: How to make the Snake Robot "sense" its environment? How to know where to move?

What do I need to know?
    - Denavit-Hartenberg Convention
    - Snake Robot modelling
    - Snake Motion
    - How a Laser Scanner works and its application
    - Computer Vision, Camera analysis, Edge detection etc.
    - Efficient representation of a 3D world
