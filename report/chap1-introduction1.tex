Making an autonomous robot have been the goal of scientists and engineers for years. This
is a difficult task which include many disciplines, and has up to date, not been solved in
a general way. Robots which can reason and take own decisions based on how it senses the
environment would greatly simplify our lives in many ways. Many tasks could be completely
outsourced to autonomous robots which does not tier, and is expendable. This means that it
can go places that a human could not. In short this can be summarized into the three Ds,
namely \emph{dull, dirty} and \emph{dangerous} work. Imagine an autonomous robot going
into a earthquake area and mapping out dangerous spots, and where injured people are,
before medical personnel enter the area. Or a robot mapping and inspecting the vast sewer
network of large city, searching for weak spots and clogged pipes which obstructs the
sewer flow. Or robots crawling the pipelines carrying water, oil or gas to detect leaks
which will cause catastrophic events if not tended to. This are all important work, which
either is dangerous, dirty or dull, or all three at once.
