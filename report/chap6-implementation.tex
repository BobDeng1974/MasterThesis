\section{Low-level Interfaces}
The low-level interfaces from the sensors are implemented in 


\section{Mid-level Implantations}

\subsection{Analysis of 3D Sensor Data}

\subsubsection{Filtering of ToF Data}


\subsubsection{Surface Fit Algorithm}


\paragraph{Guass-Newton Least Squares}


\paragraph{Issues}
The algorithm is sensitive to edge data. This can be controlled with limiting the interval
in the z-direction of which the cylinder is fitted to the data.*************FIX*******


\section{High-level Implementations}

\subsection{World Representation}
The world representation are implemented as objects in Matlab.
