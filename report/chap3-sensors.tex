\subsection{Stereo Camera}



\subsubsection{Camera Calibration}
To work with stereo images the captured images need to be rectified, i.e. the images need
to be corrected for distortion introduced by the camera lenses. This is a part of
calibrating the camera, meaning that the intrinsic parameters of the camera are
determined. That is distortion coefficients, and other camera parameters. 

Figure \ref{cahp3:fig-lensdist} below shows how the camera lenses of the Stereo camera distorts the pictures
towards the edges of the lens. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \caption{The left and right camera distortion due to lens nonlinearities}
    \label{chap3:fig-lensdist}
\end{figure}

This distortion can be removed and are called rectifying the image. This makes common
features in the two images aligned horizontally. This makes it much easier for the matching
algorithm because it only need to match vertically.





\subsection{Time-of-Flight Camera}
The time of flight camera gives out either Cartesian coordinates or intensity. This
intensity is the amplitude of the returned laser light. Figure
\ref{chap3:fig-tof-amppicture} shows a typical amplitude plot of the inside of a pipe.

\section{Sensor Configurations}
There are a couple of possible sensor configurations available for this project. ***SHOULD
MAYBE BE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION CHAPTER?****

The Laser Range Finder should alway be used in every sensor configuration. This should be
the primary source of length measurements since this is the most accurate of all the range
devices. 

The stereo camera might be looked upon as a cheap type of the Time-of-Flight camera. So
the two possible configurations are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Laser Range Finder and Stereo Camera
    \item Laser Range Finder and Time-of-Flight Camera
\end{itemize}
The Stereo Camera will give sparse range data, while the Time-of-Flight camera will give
dense range data.
