\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap9}
To draw conclusions from the results in Chapter \ref{chap7} and \ref{chap8} are difficult.
The proposed algorithms lacked selection and segmentation of the data. This was fatal
because the system needed to reason and the background of what it was looking for was
wrong. 


This project can be seen as a mapping project on what to be on the look-out for when
designing this kind of system. This include, sensor calibration, sensor data
segmentation
