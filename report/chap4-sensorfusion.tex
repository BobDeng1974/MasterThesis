\chapter{Sensor Fusion}
Multi sensor fusion is an important aspect when it comes to large systems. This because it
can provide extra resolution or better estimates of the current situation. The need for
this when the systems are big and complex are obvious. But this is also important in
smaller systems. This gives the system abilities to ``feel'' more of its surroundings
without user input. ************!!!!!!!!!!!************
