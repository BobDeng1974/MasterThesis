\chapter{Background}
This chapter will try to outline the basics needed to understand this report. Mathematical
knowledge are crucial to understand the principles used in robot navigation and decision
making.

\subsection{Distance Measurement Principles}
There are several ways to measure distance. Most principles measures the distance
indirectly, i.e. the distance is calculated using the travel time of either light- or
sound waves. Laser range finders (LRFs) and sonar are examples of this way to measure
distance. 

When looking at Laser Range Finder, there are 3 techniques for determining the distance,
\emph{optical triangulation}, \emph{pulse Time-of-Flight} and \emph{frequency modulated
continuous wave} (FMCW). \cite{laser-ranging-critical-review}
