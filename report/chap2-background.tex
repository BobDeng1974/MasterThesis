\chapter{Background}
This chapter will try to outline the basics needed to understand this report. Mathematical
knowledge are crucial to understand the principles used in robot navigation and decision
making.

\subsection{Distance Measurement Principles}
There are several ways to measure distance. Most principles measures the distance
indirectly, i.e. by processing the reflected signal of either light-, radio- or
sound waves. Laser range finders (LRFs) and sonar are examples of this way to measure
distance. 

When looking at Laser Range Finder, there are 3 techniques for determining the distance,
\emph{optical triangulation}, \emph{pulse Time-of-Flight} and \emph{frequency modulated
continuous wave} (FMCW). \cite{laser-ranging-critical-review}

\subsubsection{Optical Triangulation}
Optical triangulation is performed by using a light source and a placed at known distance
from each other. This distance is called the baseline. This is a triangulation setup which
allows for the calculation of the intersection point between the lines.

This method has some fundamental limits. \cite{laser-ranging-critical-review} 

This technique is mostly used when the measured distance is short and the need for
extremely precise measurements. For example digitalization of 3D objects.


\subsubsection{Pulsed Time-of-Flight}
The laser light which is emitted are amplitude modulated, and the received signal is
compared to the emitted signal and the phase delay is measured. This is then directly
proportional to the distance the light traveled.
